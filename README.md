# Hangman Game

This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The player is tasked with guessing a word letter by letter, with a limited number of incorrect attempts allowed.

## Project Structure

### 1. `hangman_game.py`

- Contains the main code for the Hangman game.
- Defines functions to choose a random word, display the word state, and implement the game logic.
- Allows the player to guess letters until they correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.

## How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `hangman_game.py`.
2. Run the program using the command:
    
    ```bash
    python hangman_game.py
    
    ```
    

## Gameplay

1. The game welcomes the player and selects a random word.
2. The player is prompted to guess a letter.
3. The current state of the word is displayed with blanks for unguessed letters.
4. Incorrect guesses result in the deduction of attempts.
5. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and expand upon this project based on your requirements. You can add more words to the list, enhance the user interface, or implement additional features such as scoring.
